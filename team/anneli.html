							“I am currently learning how to design by using prototyping softwares and by building physical prototypes. I am also learning how to speak Spanish (estoy aprendiendo hablar español) and I am also constantly in the kitchen learning new culinary techniques and exploring new cuisines! For more about me, you can view my portfolio.”</p>

							<p> Anneli develops child­-driven and machine­-guided technologies that empower children to share their voices with others, while teaching important literacy skills and fostering a love of reading and writing. At the MIT Media Lab’s Laboratory for Social Machines, she is a team member of Playful Words. This project starts with the belief that literacy is an inherently social activity that is best learned within a supportive community network comprised of peers, families, and teachers. Anneli’s particular interest is in storytelling and how it can motivate young learners and families by providing self­-expressive, socially collaborative, and playful literacy learning opportunities. She has had a lot of experience in the field of education, working as a therapist, preschool teacher, literacy instructor, tutor, researcher, and online literacy curriculum designer.</p>
