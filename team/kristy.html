							“I’m currently learning how to be a mom to two kids (#2 arrived in June!) and all the amazing, sometimes challenging, experiences that come along with that. I’m also learning American Sign Language (ASL) as well as how to found and fund clubs at MIT. We just launched a new ASA-recognized student club, the ASL & Deaf Culture club, and now offer three ASL classes — free to the MIT community — taught right here at the Media Lab!”</p>

							<p> Kristy Johnson earned her BS and MS in physics, with research in astronomy, plasma physics, and superfluid helium fluid dynamics. Her career then took an abrupt shift when her son was born with an extremely rare genetic disorder involving global developmental delays and autism, prompting her to turn her research pursuits toward the fields of cognitive neuroscience and affective, educational technology. Now, as a PhD student in the Affective Computing group, she studies motivation-driven learning as a mechanism to understand and enhance cognition, regulation, and engagement — particularly for individuals with complex developmental needs. Her goal is to build responsive, customizable tools that empower individuals to learn and interact with their world in ways previously considered impossible.
