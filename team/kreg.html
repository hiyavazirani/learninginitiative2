“I’m currently exploring the intersection between digital and physical computing. Through the use of Arduino products, electronic components, copper tape, and Scratch, I’m learning about how to create more intuitive systems for young learners to be creative and to express themselves in the physical world.”</p>

							<p> Kreg builds tools that bridge the physical and digital worlds, enabling kids to write computer programs that access information from sensors and control lights, motors, and sounds.
							As a member of the Scratch team, Kreg develops systems that can promote creativity and expression. These types of physical-digital projects are engaging to a wide diversity of children, and they also help kids gain a deeper understanding of the process of design (since they have the opportunity to design with both physical and digital media). Before joining the Media Lab, Kreg worked to launch computer programming in Boston public schools, both during the school day and in after-school clubs. He is also an active contributor to the ScratchX extensions community.
